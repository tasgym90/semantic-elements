      <h1>Lesson 01 Homework Assignment - Summary of Semantic Elements</h1>
      <p>The purpose of <b>semantic elements</b> is to provide helpful information for both web developers and browsers. Semantic elements help to define the content that exists on a web page by giving browsers directions for how the information should be displayed. Depending on their purpose and characteristics, semantic elements will manifest differently on a webpage. For example, they help to distinguish the header from the body of a paragraph. When used effectively, Semantic elements impact the end userâ€™s experience interacting with the page. There is an <em>important</em> distinction between semantic and non-semantic elements. Non-semantic elements tell us nothing about the content on a page, but impact how the content is displayed.</p>
